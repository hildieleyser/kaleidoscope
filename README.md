# Kaleidoscope

The code behind Kaleidoscope - where brains get interesting without the academic hangover. This neuroscience blog refuses to choose between being scientifically accurate and actually readable by humans.

Features:
- A design that doesn't scream "I learned HTML in 1998"
- Visualizations that make you go "oh, so THAT'S how my brain does that"
- Content ranging from "why we forget where we put our keys" to "consciousness: what's the deal?"
- References that actually exist (revolutionary, I know)
- Zero stock photos of glowing blue brains

Built by someone who got tired of deciphering dense papers just to understand what's happening inside their own head. Kaleidoscope: because neuroscience is too fascinating to be boring.

## Content Guidelines

Kaleidoscope content follows these principles:

- **Clarity without oversimplification**: We explain complex concepts clearly without stripping away important nuance
- **Evidence-based**: All articles are thoroughly researched and properly cited
- **Engaging narrative**: We use storytelling techniques to make scientific concepts more accessible
- **Practical relevance**: We connect neuroscience to everyday experiences when possible
